  "description": "Sway is an application that allows party-goers to request songs at events, making it easier for DJs to manage and play music requests. Users can join a room via a unique code and submit their song requests anonymously or with their name, while DJs can manage and prioritize requests in real-time. The app leverages the Spotify API to allow users to search and select songs from Spotify's vast catalog, streamlining the song request process for both attendees and DJs.",
